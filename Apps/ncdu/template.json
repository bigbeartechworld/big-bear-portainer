It is designed to find space hogs on a remote server where you donâ€™t have an entire graphical setup available, but it is a useful tool even on regular desktop systems. Ncdu aims to be fast, simple and easy to use, and should be able to run in any minimal POSIX-like environment with ncurses installed. Software made by Yorhel at https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu",
